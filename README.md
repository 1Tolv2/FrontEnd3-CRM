<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Customer Relationship Management app, CRM, is my examination project for my Front End 3 course.
The project determines my final grade, we have a grade system of G, good, and VG, very good so I will have the parts marked with VG that were needed to be incorporated to get that specific grade. The API is provided by our teacher.
The features progress bars are just dummies and not functioning bars.

### Graded requirements

Following are the requirements of the examination project and what we needed to show that we were able to use.
* React
* JSX
* React Router DOM
* useState
* useEffect
* VG: useContext (save customer list and logged in user in Context)
* Styled Components
** Create styled components
** VG: inherit CSS-properties from other components

#### 1. Log in user
Here there will be input field displayed for email and password with a log in button. When the button is pressed a call is
made to /api-token-auth/ with the email and password. In response we will receive a token.

#### 2. Home page
When the user logged in successfully, we navigate to /home
Features on the home page:
* List all customers which is connected to the user (GET /api/v1/customers)
* Give the user the ability to add customers (POST /api/v1/customers)
  - The user is going to need to register the following values to create a customer:
    - name: string (required by the API)
    - organisationNr: string
    - vatNr: string
      - VG: Validate the input field so that it follows the format SE followed by 10 numbers
    - reference: string
    - paymentTerm: integer (If not added will automatically be put to 30)
    - website: string
    - email: string
    - phoneNumber: string
  - When the new customer has been created the customer list will be updated
* Show what user is logged in (api/v1/me) with the following information:
  - email, firstName and lastName

#### 3. Detail view of specific customer
* The specific customers information will be displayed:
  - name
  - organisationNr
  - vatNr
  - reference
  - paymentTerm
  - website
  - email
  - phoneNumber
* VG: Have a delete button that removes the customer (DELETE /api/v1/customers/${id}). After the customer is deleted navigate to the home page. (/home)
* VG: Give the user the possibility to change the customers information (PUT/PATCH)

#### 4. VG: Create a user
Add the feature to create a user (PUT /auth/users).
The email that is used will receive an activation email, so you need to be able to access that email.

#### 5. VG: Activate user
In the email you receive you get a link with a uid and a token. When clicked we get to our /login page, use useLocation and URLSearchParams to get the uid and token.
When we have those we will POST the uid and token to auth/users/activate.
After successfully activating the user, navigate to /login without the uid and token parameter.
